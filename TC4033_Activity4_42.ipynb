        "1. Define Text Generation Function:\n",
        "  - `def generate_text(model, start_text, num_words, temperature=1.0):`: Defines a function for generating text given a trained model, a starting text sequence (`start_text`), and the number of words to generate (`num_words`). The optional parameter `temperature` controls the level of randomness in the generation.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Set Model to Evaluation Mode:\n",
        "  - `model.eval()`: Sets the model to evaluation mode, indicating that no gradients need to be computed during generation.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Tokenize the Starting Text and Initialize Hidden State:\n",
        "  - `words = tokeniser(start_text)`: Tokenizes the starting text using the provided tokenizer.\n",
        "  - `hidden = model.init_hidden(1)`: Initializes the hidden state for the LSTM model. The batch size is set to 1 for text generation.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Generate Text Loop:\n",
        "  - `with torch.no_grad():`: Ensures that no gradients are calculated during the generation loop.\n",
        "  - `for _ in range(num_words):`: Iterates over the specified number of words to generate.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Prepare Input for the Model:\n",
        "  - `x = torch.tensor([[vocab[word] for word in words[-seq_length:]]], dtype=torch.long, device=device)`: Creates a tensor representing the input sequence for the model. It includes the last `seq_length` words from the generated text.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Forward Pass Through the Model:\n",
        "  - `y_pred, hidden = model(x, hidden)`: Performs a forward pass through the model to get predictions for the next word.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. Sample the Next Word:\n",
        "  - `last_word_logits = y_pred[0][-1]`: Extracts the logits for the last word in the sequence.\n",
        "  - `p = F.softmax(last_word_logits / temperature, dim=0).cpu().numpy()`: Applies a softmax function with temperature to the logits, creating a probability distribution.\n",
        "  - `word_index = np.random.choice(len(last_word_logits), p=p)`: Samples the next word index based on the probability distribution.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. Append the Predicted Word to the Sequence:\n",
        "  - `words.append(vocab.lookup_token(word_index))`: Appends the predicted word to the list of generated words.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. Return the Generated Text:\n",
        "  - `return ' '.join(words)`: Joins the generated words into a text string."
